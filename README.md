Symfony2 Event Dispatcher as PHP extension
==========================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fezfez/symfony2-eventdispatcher-extension.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jolicode/symfony2-eventdispatcher-extension)

This is an experimental WIP of the Symfony2 [EventDispatcher](https://github.com/symfony/EventDispatcher/tree/2.4) (version 2.4) rewritten in [Zephir](http://zephir-lang.com/index.html).

Some stuffs does not work at the moment:

- https://github.com/phalcon/zephir/issues/131
- https://github.com/phalcon/zephir/issues/124
- SegFault... :cry:

This is a work in progress, tests are red even if the extension compile. Also, do not use this in production. Yet.
The goal is to be able to run the phpunit tests from the original component against the extension.

Install
-------

You will need [Zephir](https://github.com/phalcon/zephir) to build and install this extension.

Running the test
----------------

    composer install
    zephir build && php -dextension=symfony.so /usr/local/bin/phpunit

License
-------

Everything is under the same [MIT license](https://github.com/symfony/EventDispatcher/blob/2.4/LICENSE) as Symfony2.
